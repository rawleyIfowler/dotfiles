# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. I try my best to sort them by application. Most of these go together, excluding NeoVim and Vim, however my main setup is my fork of dwm, st, NeoVim, Bash, and more recently Doom Emacs.

## Doom Emacs
I maintain a configuration for Doom Emacs, which, as of May 2022, is my go to editor.

## Vim and Neovim
I have a `.vimrc` and a Neovim `init.lua`. I maintain both the `.vimrc` for legacy purposes, and if I need to do quick edits I still use Neovim (and exclusively for OpenBSD), so it stays decently up to date. Otherwise, I use Doom Emacs.

## Shells
On OpenBSD I use exclusively the Korn Shell, while on Linux I use Bash & Fish, and on MacOS I use ZSH. You can find all of my configurations here, aswell.

## Screenshots
The following is my Parabola system using my forks of [dwm](https://www.github.com/rawleyfowler/dwm), [st](https://www.github.com/rawleyfowler/st), and my NeoVim configuration.
