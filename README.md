# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, I use them on a variety of systems, so they have some OS/Platform specific changes. I use a FreeBSD Desktop, Parabola GNU/Linux-libre laptop, and for work, a 2019 Macbook Pro. None of my dotfiles have Windows specific adjustments.

## Development
I use a customized version of vanilla Evil Emacs, for most of my development. I also maintain a NeoVim configuration that I use for quick edits. I mainly develop for the JVM (Java, and Clojure), or for the frontend with TypeScript (Angular) and Elm. I also program with various flavors of Lisp. These drastically impact how my editors are configured.

You'll find modes for Java, D, Clojure, TypeScript, Elm, and C/C++ in my Emacs config, however I've set it up so it's easy to add others if you'd like.

## Screenshots
This is my macbook with Emacs (note I use `brew install --cask emacs`):
