# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. I try my best to sort them by application. Most of these go together, excluding NeoVim and Vim, however my main setup is my fork of dwm, st, NeoVim, and Bash.

## Vim and NeoVim
I maintain a configuration for Vim and NeoVim at the moment, since I use both on different machines. However, if you are looking to use my dwm, and st builds you'll want to use my NeoVim configuration.

## Shells
On OpenBSD I use exclusively the Korn Shell, while on Linux I use bash. You can find both of those configurations here. As of April 29th, 2022 I've been using the fish shell aswell on Linux.

## Screenshots
The following is my Parabola system using my forks of [dwm](https://www.github.com/rawleyfowler/dwm), [st](https://www.github.com/rawleyfowler/st), and my NeoVim configuration.
