# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, I use them on a 2019 Macbook, and various other Linux systems.

## Development
I use a customized version of vanilla Emacs for most of my development. I also maintain a NeoVim configuration that I use for quick edits. I mainly develop for the JVM (Java, and Clojure), or for the frontend with TypeScript (Angular) and Elm. I also program with various flavors of Lisp.

## Screenshots
This is my macbook with Emacs, and zsh.

The following is my Parabola system using my forks of [dwm](https://www.github.com/rawleyfowler/dwm), [st](https://www.github.com/rawleyfowler/st), and my NeoVim configuration.
