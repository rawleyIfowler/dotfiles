# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, I use them on 2 systems primarily. My Librebooted Thinkpad x200 running OpenBSD, and my desktop FreeBSD machine. I use xterm, cwm, Bash, and GNU Emacs. You'll find my configurations for both OpenBSD and FreeBSD in their respective folders.

## Development
100% of my development happens with my minimal GNU Emacs setup. I develop mostly using OCaml, Ruby, Scala, Perl, and C, among others. These languages influence my dotfiles quite heavily and you may have troubles copying my setup if you plan to use other languages. I do my best to 'de-bloat' and update this repository as frequently as possible.
