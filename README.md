# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, I use them on 2 systems, a Librebooted Thinkpad x200 on OpenBSD, and a Desktop Debian Linux machine. I use [st](https://github.com/rawleyfowler/st), [dwm](https://github.com/rawleyfowler/dwm), Bash, and NeoVim. You'll find my configurations for both OpenBSD and Debian Linux here.

## Development
100% of my development happens with my minimal GNU Emacs setup. I develop mostly using OCaml, Ruby, TypeScript, C++, and C, among others. These languages influence my dotfiles quite heavily and you may have troubles copying my setup if you plan to use other languages. I do my best to 'de-bloat' and update this repository as frequently as possible.
