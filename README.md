# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, I use them on 2 systems, a Librebooted Thinkpad x200 on OpenBSD, and a Desktop Void Linux machine. I use [st](https://github.com/rawleyfowler/st), [dwm](https://github.com/rawleyfowler/dwm), Bash, and NeoVim. You'll find my configurations for both OpenBSD and Void Linux here.

## Development
100% of my development happens with NeoVim, on Unix based machines. I develop mostly for the web, I use Ruby, Clojure, TypeScript, among others. These languages influence my dotfiles quite heavily and you may have troubles copying my setup if you plan to use other languages.
