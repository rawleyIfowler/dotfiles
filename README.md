## dotfiles
These dotfile are for my fish, and neovim configs. Currently I am using neovim with my customized version of the melange color scheme. You can check that out [here](https://gitlab.com/rawleyIfowler/melange).

### Directories
Each "dotfile" may or may not be grouped by OS or machine. These are meant to go together. If they are in the root directory, the config hasn't found a specific home yet.
